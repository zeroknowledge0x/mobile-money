## Key Decisions & Recommendations

### Bridge Provider Selection

| Provider | Recommendation | Use Case |
|----------|---|---|
| **Custom Locked-Minted** | ✅✅✅ PRIMARY | Full control, compliance, regulatory clarity |
| **Allbridge** | ✅ SECONDARY | Liquidity optimization, optional Layer 2 |
| **SEP-41** | ⏳ FUTURE | Revisit 2027 when mature |
| **Wormhole** | ❌ NOT VIABLE | Discontinued Stellar support |
| **CCIP** | ⏳ FUTURE | Enterprise expansion Phase 3+ |
| **IBC** | ⏳ FUTURE | Cosmos integration Phase 4 |

### Technical Architecture

**Locked-Minted Model Chosen Because:**
1. ✅ Maximum platform control and flexibility
2. ✅ Native compliance/KYC integration
3. ✅ Regulatory clarity (owned bridge)
4. ✅ No custodian risk
5. ✅ Scalable to multiple assets/chains
6. ✅ Sustainable business model (direct fees)

**Validator Consensus (2-of-3):**
- 2 foundation-run validators (primary)
- 2 exchange partners (secondary) 
- 5+ community validators (decentralization)
- Multi-sig ensures security without single point of failure
