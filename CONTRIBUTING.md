## 🏷️ Issue Labels

- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention needed
- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `question`: Further information requested
- `wontfix`: This will not be worked on
- `duplicate`: This issue already exists
- `invalid`: This doesn't seem right

## 🎯 Good First Issues

New to the project? Look for issues labeled `good first issue`:

**Examples:**
- Add input validation
- Improve error messages
- Add unit tests
- Update documentation
- Fix typos
- Add logging

## 🔔 CI Slack Notifications

When a CI run fails on the `main` branch, an automatic Slack notification is sent with the workflow name, triggering actor, commit SHA, and a direct link to the failed run.

### Required secret

| Secret name | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Create an [Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) in your Slack workspace, then add the generated URL as a repository secret under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. |

Notifications fire **only** on `main` branch failures. Passing builds and pull-request runs are never notified.

## 🔒 Security Issues

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email security@yourdomain.com with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We'll respond within 48 hours.

## 📚 Documentation

### Types of Documentation

1. **Code Comments**: Explain complex logic
2. **API Documentation**: Document all endpoints
3. **README**: Keep up-to-date
4. **Architecture Docs**: Explain system design
5. **Migration Guides**: For breaking changes

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams where helpful
- Keep it up-to-date

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  describe('Method/Function Name', () => {
    it('should do something specific', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = 'test';
      
      // Act
      const result = functionUnderTest(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe('expected');
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows
4. **Load Tests**: Test performance under load

### Mocking

- Mock external services (APIs, databases)
- Use Jest mocks for dependencies
- Keep mocks simple and focused

## 🌐 Internationalization

When adding user-facing text:

```typescript
// Use i18n
import { t } from '../utils/i18n';

const message = t('errors.transaction.insufficient_funds');
```

Add translations to `src/locales/`.

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use database indexes
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Profile before optimizing
- Document performance-critical code

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Use security headers (Helmet)

## 📦 Dependencies

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
# Production dependency
npm install package-name

# Development dependency
npm install --save-dev package-name
```

**Guidelines:**
- Justify new dependencies
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Prefer well-maintained packages
- Consider bundle size impact

### Updating Dependencies

```bash
# Check for updates
npm outdated

# Update specific package
npm update package-name

# Update all packages
npm update
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

When adding user-facing features:

- Follow existing patterns
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Test on multiple devices
- Provide clear error messages
- Include loading states
- Handle edge cases

## 🚀 Release Process

Maintainers handle releases:

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release tag
4. Publish to npm (if applicable)
5. Deploy to production

## 💬 Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: Questions, ideas, general discussion
- **Pull Requests**: Code review, implementation discussion
- **Email**: Security issues, private matters
