/**
 * HTTP method-based database routing middleware.
 * 
 * Routes database queries based on HTTP method:
 * - GET/HEAD requests → Replica pool (read-only)
 * - POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests → Primary pool (critical writes)
 * 
 * This middleware ensures that read-only GET requests are routed to replica
 * instances to balance load and reduce pressure on the primary database,
 * while all write operations are routed to the primary for data consistency.
 * 
 * Usage: Add this middleware early in your Express stack:
 *   app.use(readReplicaRoutingMiddleware);
 * 
 * The middleware attaches metadata to the request object that services
 * and data access layers can use to select the appropriate database pool.
