 * Trace-ID propagation for queue workers.

 *   import { withTraceId } from "../queue/trace";
 *   await addTransactionJob(withTraceId(req, { transactionId, ... }));
 *
 * Usage — worker side:
 *   import { traceIdFromJob, childLoggerWithTrace } from "../queue/trace";
 *   const log = childLoggerWithTrace(job.data);
 *   log.info("processing job");
