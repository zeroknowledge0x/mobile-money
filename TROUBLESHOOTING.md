# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive list of error codes used by the Mobile Money API, their meanings, and recommended solutions to resolve them.

## Error Codes Table

| Error Code | Category | Meaning | Recommended Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `INVALID_INPUT` | Validation | The request body or parameters contain invalid data types or malformed JSON. | Check your request payload against the API documentation and ensure all data types are correct. |
| `MISSING_FIELD` | Validation | A required field is missing from the request. | Verify that all mandatory fields (e.g., `amount`, `phoneNumber`) are included in your request body. |
| `INVALID_PHONE_FORMAT` | Validation | The provided phone number does not match the expected E.164 format or local provider requirements. | Ensure the phone number starts with the country code (e.g., `+237...`) and contains only digits after the plus sign. |
| `INVALID_AMOUNT` | Validation | The transaction amount is non-numeric, negative, or exceeds the maximum allowed precision. | Use a positive numeric string or number for the amount. Ensure it doesn't have more than 7 decimal places for Stellar compatibility. |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | Auth | No authentication token was provided or the token is completely invalid. | Include a valid Bearer token in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`. |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Auth | The provided username, password, or API key is incorrect. | Double-check your login credentials or API keys. Reset your password if necessary. |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Auth | The session token has expired. | Re-authenticate by calling the login endpoint to obtain a fresh access token. |
| `INVALID_TOKEN` | Auth | The provided token is malformed or has been tampered with. | Ensure you are sending the exact token received during login. Do not manually modify the token string. |
| `FORBIDDEN` | Auth | The authenticated user does not have permission to access the requested resource. | Contact your administrator to verify your role and permissions. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` | Auth | Specific action is blocked by the user's current role or account status. | Ensure you are using an account with the necessary administrative or operator privileges. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Resource | The requested endpoint or generic resource does not exist. | Check the URL path for typos and ensure you are using the correct API version prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/...`). |
| `TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND` | Resource | No transaction was found matching the provided ID. | Verify the transaction ID. It might be too old and archived, or the ID was mistyped. |
| `CONFLICT` | Conflict | The request conflicts with the current state of the server. | Review the current state of the resource you are trying to modify. Fetch the latest data before retrying. |
| `DUPLICATE_REQUEST` | Conflict | An idempotent request was received again with the same `Idempotency-Key`. | If the first request was successful, ignore this error. If not, wait a few seconds before retrying with a new key. |
| `ACCOUNT_LOCKED` | Security | Too many failed login attempts have resulted in a temporary account lockout. | Wait 15-30 minutes for the lockout to expire, or contact support to manually unlock the account. |
| `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Business | The transaction exceeds daily, weekly, or monthly volume limits for the account. | Check your account tier limits. You may need to complete further KYC verification to increase limits. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Business | The user's mobile money or internal wallet balance is lower than the requested amount + fees. | Top up the account or reduce the transaction amount to stay within the available balance. |
| `PROVIDER_ERROR` | Provider | The external Mobile Money provider (MTN, Orange, Airtel) returned an error or is unreachable. | This is often temporary. Retry the request after a short delay. Check the provider's status page if available. |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | Security | Too many requests were sent in a short period. | Implement exponential backoff in your client logic. Reduce the frequency of API calls. |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Server | An unexpected error occurred on the server side. | Contact the technical support team with the `requestId` provided in the error response for investigation. |
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | Server | The service is temporarily down for maintenance or is overloaded. | Wait a few minutes and try again. Check for scheduled maintenance announcements. |
| `DATABASE_ERROR` | Server | A failure occurred while communicating with the persistent storage. | This is a critical system error. Wait for the system to recover or report it if it persists. |

## General Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Check the `requestId`**: Every error response includes a `requestId`. Always keep this ID when contacting support; it allows developers to find the exact logs for your failure.
2.  **Validate JSON**: Ensure your request body is valid JSON. A missing comma or mismatched bracket often results in `INVALID_INPUT`.
3.  **Check Headers**: Many endpoints require `Content-Type: application/json` and `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
4.  **Sandbox vs Production**: Ensure you are hitting the correct environment. Credentials for Sandbox will not work in Production.
